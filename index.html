              <p>January 2015 - Present                                 University Of Greenwich, London
              I was tasked to video and audio record the performances of Lectures and speakers during the 2014 Digital Research in the Humanities and arts conference which was held in the University of Greenwich. Guest speakers would come and deliver their research ideas and creative projects to the audience with explanation. I recorded the keynotes and speeches than edited the footages and finally placing them on the archive to be viewed online. The conference lasted 3 months.
